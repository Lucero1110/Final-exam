At the beginning of the class I thought it was going to be difficult and that I was not going to like the class, however, as the classes went by I understood the topics better, apart from that I liked that he gave us stickers because that encouraged class participation.
The topics are not difficult if one pays attention, since if you get distracted for a moment everything becomes confusing, luckily I asked my doubts and that way I understood better.
I liked the fun facts at each break because it lessened the stress and distracted us from all the programming. Another point to highlight is that I learned new tools and programming language that I consider I will use later.
I would advise having several alternatives to explain a topic because we, being second semester and in business, do not know much, so it is difficult for us to understand why we do all the programming codes.
